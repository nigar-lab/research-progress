**01/29~02/14**  
  - Convert Python source code into graph embeddings.  
  - Apply cosine similarity to detect semantic code clones.  
  - Analyze the results of the cosine similarity approach.    
  - Begin collecting Python function datasets from online repositories (starting with GitHub).  
**02/14~02/28**
  -Conducted an initial investigation into graph-based approaches for Type-4 code clone detection.
  -Studied the research paper: “TAILOR: Learning Graph-based Code Representations for Source-level Functional Similarity Detection” to understand the proposed methodology and model design.
  -Reviewed additional literature on code clone detection using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and Flow-Augmented Abstract Syntax Trees (FA-ASTs) to explore complementary techniques.
**02/29~04/24**
  -Focused on adapting the TAILOR methodology for Python code, taking into account the syntactic and semantic characteristics of Python as a dynamically typed language.
